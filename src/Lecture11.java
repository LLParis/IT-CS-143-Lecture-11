        // each array below.
        // Show the sub-arrays that are created by the algorithm and show the merging of

        // A. {29, 17, 3, 94, 46, 8, –4, 12}
        // B. {6, 5, 3, 7, 1, 8, 4, 2}

        // 11. Using the following arrays, trace the complete execution of the merge
        // sort algorithm when called on each array.
        // Show the subarrays that are created by the algorithm and show the merging of
        // subarrays into larger sorted arrays.

        // A. int[] numbers3 = {8, 5, –9, 14, 0, –1, –7, 3};
        // B. int[] numbers4 = {15, 56, 24, 5, 39, –4, 27, 10};

        // 13. Using the following arrays, trace the complete execution of the merge
        // sort algorithm when called on each array.
        // Show the subarrays that are created by the algorithm and show the merging of
        // subarrays into larger sorted arrays.

        // A. int[] numbers5 = {22, 44, 11, 88, 66, 33, 55, 77};
        // B. int[] numbers6 = {–3, -6, -1, -5, 0, -2, -4, -7};
